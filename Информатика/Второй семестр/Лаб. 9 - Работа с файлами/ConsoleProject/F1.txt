BURY THE LIGHT

Immortal temptation
Takes over my mind
Condemned
Falling weak on my knees
Summon the strength
Of mayhem

I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames
I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death!
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery
Destiny chasing time

Inherit the nightmare
Surrounded by fate
Can’t run away
Keep walking the line
Between the light
Led astray

Through vacant halls I won’t surrendår
The truth revealåd in eyes of ember
We fight through fire and ice forever
Two souls once lost, and now they remember

I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames
I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death!
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery
Destiny chasing time
Disappear into the night
Lost shadows left behind
Obsession's pulling me
Fading, I've come to take what's mine!

Lurking in the shadows under veil of night
Constellations of blood pirouette
Dancing through the graves of those who stand at my feet
Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat
A derelict of dark, summoned from the ashes
The puppetmaster congregates all the masses
Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit
You want this power? Then come try and take it
[Breakdown]
Beyond the tree
Fire burns
Secret love
Bloodline yearns
Dark minds embrace
Crimson joy
Does your dim heart
Heal or destroy?

Bury the light deep within!
Cast aside, there's no coming home!
We're burning chaos in the wind!
Drifting in the ocean all alone!



DEVIL TRIGGER

I'll endure the exile
I'll endure the exile

The darkness of night falls around my soul
And the hunter within loses control
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
This demon inside has ahold of me
Clenching its power, trying to break free
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out

Move fast baby, don't be slow
Step aside, reload, time to go
I can't seem to control
All this rage that's inside me
Pullin' shots, aimin' dots, yeah, I don't miss
Branded by fire, born in the abyss
Red hot temper, I just can't resist
All this vengeance inside me

All of these thoughts runnin' through my head
Arms on fire, veins burnin' red
Frustration is gettin' bigger
Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger

Embrace the darkness that's within me
No hiding in the shadows anymore
When this wickedness consumes me
Nothing can save you and there's no way out

I'm a wildfire you won't tame
Igniting my temper, can't put out my flame
There's no way to contain
This storm swelling inside me
I'm a bomb you can't defuse
Might just accept you're gonna lose
Can't turn down, I refuse
To hold back anymore

All of these voices inside of my head
Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
Frustration is getting bigger
Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger

When the night ends, it's not over
We fight through to get closer
Like a silver bullet piercing through
I throw myself into you

All of these voices inside of my head
Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
Frustration is getting bigger
Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger



SUBHUMAN

As I stare into the eye of the coming
Apocalypse, I see them reaching for my soul
I cannot erupt. I must control
I cannot erupt. I must explode

Funny how the mind tries to sink me deeper
As the evil tries to turn me around
I will not falter, shout at the devil
As I bury them six foot underground
The hours trapped in window panes
As futile eyes peer deep
The hurt nests right in
Haunting thoughts of this crumbling world

You cannot kill me
I am Omega
You cannot kill me
I am subhuman
You cannot kill me (I cannot erupt)
I am Omega (I must control)
You cannot kill me (I cannot erupt)
I must explode

I must not forget that I have bled
Felt no respect for the demons in my head
Something saved me. Put me out of my destiny
And dropped me safely in this hell
It seared right past me, the eyes are flashing
As I call upon the dark gift to erupt
With the devil on my back, and the demons right in front
I slash through aim sights and settle up

You cannot kill me
I am Omega
You cannot kill me
I am subhuman
You cannot kill me (I cannot erupt)
I am Omega (I must control)
You cannot kill me (I cannot erupt)
I must explode

(Let me out)
(Hellbound)
I feel the devil in me (Let me out)
We're coming right for you (Hellbound)
I feel the devil in me (Let me out)
We’re coming right for you (Hellbound)



COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS

The unenlightened masses, they cannot make the judgement call
Give up free will forever, their voices won't be heard at all
Display obedience while never stepping out of line
And blindly swear allegiance, let your country control your mind
(Let your country control your soul)

Live in ignorance and purchase your happiness
When blood and sweat is the real cost
Thinking ceases, the truth is lost
Don't you worry, you'll be told exactly what to do
I give my people the lives they need
The righteous will succeed

The fires of greed will burn the weak
So we'll make freedom obsolete
Making whole the fabric of society
Collective consciousness controlled as you will see
(Mind control)

(Let your country control your soul)
(Let your country control your soul)
(Let your country control your soul)
(Let your country control your soul)



ROAR OF THE JUNGLE DRAGON

The enemy ascended beyond your control
Or was that all your intention?
They have managed to demolish whatever we made
But you're failing to comprehend

If they can, they will easily butcher you whole
While you're blinded by your depression
I have gotten to the point where I'm just too afraid
That you're going to meet your end

My screams echo out through the fire
And your rival dares stand in my way
Yes, this is a hardship most dire
And one day, you will heed what I say

This is my message to my master
This is a fight you cannot win
I think that past your great disasters
Their victory stirs below your skin

If you proceed, I will not blame you
I will move forth and win your war
But if I should die before you continue
You shall have heard my final dying roar
