Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger
Igniting my temper, can't put out my flame
All of these voices inside of my head
Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger
All of these voices inside of my head
Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger
As I stare into the eye of the coming
I cannot erupt. I must control
I cannot erupt. I must explode
You cannot kill me (I cannot erupt)
You cannot kill me (I cannot erupt)
I must not forget that I have bled
Something saved me. Put me out of my destiny
With the devil on my back, and the demons right in front
You cannot kill me (I cannot erupt)
You cannot kill me (I cannot erupt)
I feel the devil in me (Let me out)
I feel the devil in me (Let me out)
And blindly swear allegiance, let your country control your mind
(Let your country control your soul)
(Let your country control your soul)
(Let your country control your soul)
(Let your country control your soul)
(Let your country control your soul)
If they can, they will easily butcher you whole
This is my message to my master
